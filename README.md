# 🚀 Modern Portfolio: Front-End & Technical Writing Showcase

A high-performance, responsive portfolio built to demonstrate pixel-perfect UI implementation and structured technical communication. This project serves as a live resume for **Gagandeep Kaur**, highlighting a decade of experience bridging the gap between complex engineering and user-centric design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology

* **HTML5 & CSS3**: Semantic structure for SEO and accessibility.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for consistent design tokens and rapid responsiveness.
* **JavaScript**: Light-weight logic for mobile navigation and interactive UI states.
* **Mobile-First Design**: Fully fluid layouts that adapt from 320px to 4K displays.
* **Docs-as-Code Strategy**: Content structured using technical writing principles (clarity, conciseness, and hierarchy).

## ✨ Key Features & Technical Decisions

### 📱 Responsive Stacking & Navigation
To ensure a premium mobile experience, I implemented a **Sheet-style mobile menu** rather than a basic dropdown. 
* **The Solution**: Used a `backdrop-blur` overlay and a fixed-position "sheet" container that mimics modern app design.
* **Accessibility**: Added `aria-label` and `aria-hidden` attributes to ensure the menu is screen-reader friendly.

### 🎨 Advanced UI Components
* **Dynamic Hero Visual**: Created a "Floating Tech Stack" visual using nested gradients and custom shadow definitions (`shadow-[0_20px_60px_rgba(37,99,235,0.25)]`) to give a 3D depth effect without heavy image assets.
* **The Timeline Layout**: Built a vertical professional history guide using Tailwind's `border-l` and absolute positioning for custom avatars.

### 🖋️ Technical Writing Implementation
The content within this portfolio follows the **Google Developer Style Guide**:
* **Scannability**: Used "Soft-skill cards" and "Tech Tag" clusters to ensure recruiters can find key skills in under 5 seconds.
* **Information Architecture**: Organized the layout from high-level "About" to granular "Certifications," ensuring a logical user journey.
